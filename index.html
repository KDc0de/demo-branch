<h1>Branching</h1>
<p>
    Note: I created a new repo called "demo-branch" to learn how to branch;

    1.On command-line:
    > git clone SSH-address;
    > git init;
    > cd "demo-branch";

    Created this new file called index, where i can take note of my entire assignment;

    2.On command-line:
    > git status: to visualize the status of my working tree;
    > git add . ;
    > git commit -m "..." ;
    > git push;

    Created a new branch called 'feature/demo-index':
    > git checkout -b feature... ;
    > git branch: to know in what branch we are working;


    Now, we've written some notes in this file about how-to-start-branching and so we have to git add . , git commit and "git push --set-upstream origin feature/demo-index; 

    (--set-upstream) = (-u)

    > git checkout master;

    > git merge feature... ;

    > git pull ;
